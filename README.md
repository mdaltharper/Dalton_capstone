# HUD Dataset RAG Experiment

Motivation

Can LLMS can compete with Human Real Estate Data analysts? People think LLMS are a silver bullet 
and can be used for any tasks. Do they have limitations? I also am interested in Data engineering and LLM's. 
This is a very progressive project topic that could sperate from other candidates applying for jobs. The overall focus
of the project comes down how do you feed structured data to a LLM.
